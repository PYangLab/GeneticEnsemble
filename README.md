# GeneticEnsemble

Genetic Ensemble is an Java implementation of a genetic algorithm-based ensemble of classifiers designed for feature subset selection. It is wrapper-based approach that select a subset of features based of their overall performance across a set of classifiers. 

This algorithm was originally developed for selecting a panel of interacting SNPs from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), hence the name "GEsnpxPara" where "Para" stands for the implementation of parallel computing version of the algorithm. Nevertheless, the implemented software package is flexiable and can be applied for gene or protein subset selection from microarray or proteomics data.
